## Technologies in Project:

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) - React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux) - Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
- [redux-toolkit](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit) - (Formerly known as "Redux Starter Kit")
- [SASS](https://github.com/sass/sass) - Sass makes CSS fun again.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your TypeScript app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new) from the creators of Next.js.
